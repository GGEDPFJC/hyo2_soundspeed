HydrOffice is a research development environment for ocean mapping. Its aim is to provide a collection of
hydro-packages to deal with specific issues in such a field, speeding up both algorithms testing and
research-2-operation.

This package provides functionalities to manage sound speed profiles.

The package is jointly developed by NOAA OCS and UNH CCOM.
